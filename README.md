##Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology Resources
The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act ([FITARA)](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148]), passed by Congress in December 2014, is a historic law that represents the first major overhaul of Federal information Technology (IT) in almost 20 years.  Since FITARA’s passing, OMB has been developing guidance to agencies to ensure that this law is applied consistently governmentwide in a way that is both workable and effective. The purpose of this proposed guidance is to provide implementation guidance for FITARA and related information technology (IT) management practices.

If you have ideas on how to improve the proposed guidance, you may make line edit suggestions or initiate or contribute to discussions about the content of the guidance. OMB will review and incorporate public feedback, as appropriate, to develop final guidance in the coming weeks.
