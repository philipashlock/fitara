##Main Body of Proposed Guidance

###Purpose
The purpose of this memorandum is to provide implementation guidance for the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>  and related information technology (IT) management practices.

###Background
FITARA was enacted on December 19, 2014.  FITARA outlines specific requirements related to:

1.  Chief Information Officer (CIO) Authority Enhancements
2.  Enhanced Transparency and Improved Risk Management in IT Investments
3.  Portfolio Review
4.  Expansion of Training and Use of IT Cadres
5.  Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative
6.  Maximizing the Benefit of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative
7.  Government-wide Software Purchasing Program


To implement the requirements of FITARA, combined with the need to update policy and guidance related to other modern IT practices, OMB is establishing this guidance. This guidance reflects input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including representatives from the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), Assistant Secretary for Management (ASAM), Chief Operating Officer (COO), and CIO communities.

###Objectives

The objectives of the requirements outlined in this memorandum are to:

1.  Assist agencies in establishing management practices which align IT resources with agency missions, goals, programmatic priorities, and statutory requirements;
2.  Establish government-wide IT management controls that will meet FITARA requirements while providing agencies with the flexibility to adapt to agency processes and unique mission requirements;
3.  Establish the “Common Baseline” for roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the agency CIO and the roles and responsibilities of other applicable Senior Agency Officials<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup>  in managing IT as a strategic resource;
4.  Clarify the agency CIO’s role with respect to program IT, mission IT, and other cases of IT resources included in organizations that are not primarily IT-oriented;
5.  Strengthen the agency CIO’s accountability for the agency’s IT cost, schedule, and performance;
6.  Strengthen the relationship between agency CIOs and bureau CIOs;
7.  Establish consistent government-wide interpretation of FITARA terms and requirements;
8.  Assist agencies in establishing an inclusive governance process that will enable effective planning, programming, budgeting, and execution for IT resources; 
9.  Provide transparency on IT resources across entire agencies and programs; and
10.  Provide appropriate visibility and involvement of the agency CIO in the management and oversight of IT resources across the agency to support the successful implementation of cybersecurity policies to prevent interruption or exploitation of program services.

###Scope and Applicability

1.  Covered agencies: CFO Act agencies(^3)  and their divisions and offices are subject to the requirements outlined in FITARA and this memorandum, except where otherwise noted. The Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community, and portions of other agencies that operate systems related to national security are subject to only certain portions of FITARA and shall meet with OMB no later than 60 days following the release of this memorandum to clarify the applicability of this memorandum throughout their organizations and activities, including alternative requirements or exceptions. 
2.  Additionally, all other Executive Branch agencies are encouraged to apply the principles described in this guidance to their management of IT, consistent with their legal authorities. 
3.  Covered agencies shall implement this guidance in a manner consistent with other legal authorities and should consult with their counsel regarding those authorities.  
4.  With respect to Offices of Inspectors General (OIG), this guidance should be implemented in a manner that does not impact the independence of those offices and the authorities Inspectors General have over the personnel, performance, procurement, and budget of the OIG, as provided in the IG Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. app 3.  
5.  This memorandum builds upon and will refer to existing OMB policy and guidance. 
6.  Where appropriate, this guidance incorporates agency reporting requirements introduced by FITARA into existing OMB processes, such as PortfolioStat, the Integrated Data Collection (IDC)(^4), Acquisition Human Capital Planning, and the Federal IT Dashboard (ITDB), rather than creating new reporting channels and tools.


###Section A: Defining the Scope of Resources Related to Information Technology

Many of the requirements of this memorandum refer to the agency CIO’s involvement with the decision processes and policies related to “information technology resources” throughout their agency, including IT within programs. To establish a consistent government-wide interpretation of the Federal resources included in this scope, the following definition shall be used for “information technology resources”:

1.  “Information technology resources” includes all:
  - agency budgetary resources, personnel, equipment, facilities, or services that are primarily used in the management, operation, acquisition, or other activity related to the lifecycle of information technology; 
  - acquisitions or interagency agreements which include information technology and the services or equipment provided by such acquisitions or interagency agreements;
  - But does not include grants which establish or support information technology not operated directly by the Federal Government

2.  This definition and this memorandum refer to the term “information technology,” which for the purposes of this definition and memorandum is defined as:
  - Any services or equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency.
  - For purposes of this definition, such services or equipment are used by an agency if used by the agency directly or if used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires either use of the services or equipment or requires use of the services or equipment to a significant extent in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.
  - The term “information technology” includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including cloud computing and support services that support any point of the lifecycle of the equipment or service), and related resources.
  - The term “information technology” does not include any equipment that is acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract which does not require its use (see "B" above). 

This definition is based on the definition of information technology found in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996(^5) . Additional definitions used in the Common Baseline are available in _Attachment A_.

#####Revising other IT management policies to reflect this scope
To establish consistency across IT management and acquisition policies, OMB Circular A-130, OMB Circular A-11, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will be updated to reflect these definitions of “information technology resources” and “information technology,” as appropriate.


###Section B: Implementation of the Common Baseline

1. The “Common Baseline” (_Attachment A_) provides guidance on the CIO’s and other Senior Agency Officials’ roles and responsibilities for the management of IT.  This Common Baseline provides a framework for agencies to implement the specific authorities that FITARA provides for CFO Act agency CIOs, which build upon their responsibilities as outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996(^6) .  The Common Baseline also speaks to the roles and responsibilities of other Senior Agency Officials, as it is critical that these officials in each covered agency are engaged in the oversight of IT investments.

2. All covered agencies shall institute procedures that implement the roles, responsibilities, and requirements found in the Common Baseline. The Common Baseline provides agencies with certain flexibility to adopt procedures that meet these requirements in a manner tailored to the volume and type of work completed by the agencies.  As explained further in _Attachment A_, agencies may adopt a plan that provides for the CIO’s direct involvement or a framework approved by the CIO that contains clear rules on the procedures by which decisions are made and articulates that the CIO remains responsible and accountable for those decisions (referred to as the “CIO Assignment Plan” in _Attachment A_). Further detail is provided in the “CIO Assignment Plan” section found in _Attachment A_.

3. Each agency shall take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:

  - **Complete agency self-assessment and plan.** Each covered agency shall conduct a self-assessment and articulate a plan describing the changes it will make to ensure that all Common Baseline responsibilities described in _Attachment A_ are implemented by December 31, 2015. This self-assessment and plan shall not exceed 25 pages and shall include the template in _Attachment C_. 

  - **Submit to OMB for acceptance of plan.** Covered agencies shall no later than August 15, 2015 submit this self-assessment and this plan to OMB’s Office of E-government & Information Technology (E-Gov) as well as to the agency’s relevant OMB Resource Management Office for review and acceptance. Please submit these by email to egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line: “[Agency Abbreviation] FITARA Common Baseline Plan.”  OMB may request additional information from agencies before accepting the plan.  Agencies shall post the “plan” portion of this document (not the “self-assessment”) on their public website at agency.gov/digitalstrategy no more than 30 days following OMB approval and thereafter keep the public document up to date with access to a history of previous versions.

  - **Support ongoing oversight of plan and Common Baseline.** Covered agencies shall follow OMB guidance from PortfolioStat sessions and other oversight activities regarding the ongoing implementation of the Common Baseline. Agencies shall notify OMB of any obstacles or incomplete implementation of the Common Baseline on an ongoing basis following the initial implementation deadline. OMB may request agencies to revise or update agency self-assessments or plans during implementation as more information becomes available about the agency's management processes.

  - **Conduct annual review and update to self-assessment.** In accordance with OMB guidance, covered agencies shall update the self-assessment annually to identify any obstacles or incomplete implementation of Common Baseline responsibilities over the preceding 12 months. The first update will be due April 30, 2016, and each April 30 on an annual basis thereafter.  

4. The following additional actions will be taken to support agencies’ implementation of the Common Baseline:

  - **Federal CIO Council (the Council) shall develop and share on-going support and tools.** Through the end of FY2016, the Council will dedicate time in its meetings to discuss current topics related to the implementation of the Common Baseline at least once every quarter. The Council will also assist agencies in implementing the Common Baseline by sharing examples of agency governance processes and IT policies on a public website at https://management.cio.gov. 

  - **Support President’s Management Council (PMC) follow-up**. By June 30, 2015 the PMC will select three members from the Council to provide an update on government-wide implementation of FITARA on a quarterly basis through the end of FY2016. These updates will improve each agency’s awareness of policies and processes which have worked well at other agencies.

###Section C: Transparency, Risk Management, Portfolio Review, and Reporting

1. Covered agencies shall continue to report required data to OMB as part of the quarterly IDC,  per current instructions . OMB will continue to update IDC instructions posted on the MAX Federal Community on a quarterly basis. 

  - **Standardized cost savings metrics and performance indicators.** As a part of the IDC reporting requirements, agencies shall continue to provide cost savings and cost avoidance achieved as a result of strategies that the agency has decided to adopt.  Based on this information, agencies will be provided a summary scorecard that provides agency-specific performance metric data and portfolio analysis agenda items.

  - **Sharing with the public and Congress.** As required by P.L. 113-235(^7), OMB will continue to report quarterly to Congress on the cost savings, avoidance and reductions in duplicative IT investments resulting from the above agency efforts. OMB will also provide a summary of these savings by agency on a publicly accessible website. Agency reporting requirements for these topics are included in the IDC instructions.

2.  Covered agencies shall continue to provide information to the ITDB, as required by OMB’s capital planning and investment control (CPIC) guidance, which is issued annually in conjunction with the release of OMB Circular A-11 (^8).   As a part of that guidance, the following approaches will be used to meet FITARA requirements:

  - **Monthly reporting.** Covered agencies shall continue to provide updates of risks, performance metrics, project, and activity data for major IT investments to the ITDB as soon as the data becomes available, or at least once each calendar month.

  - **Data improvement program.** If OMB or the agency CIO determines data reported to the ITDB is not timely and reliable, the CIO (in consultation with the agency head) must notify OMB through the IDC and establish within 30 days of this determination an improvement program to address the deficiencies. The CIO will collaborate with OMB to develop a plan that includes root cause analysis, timeline to resolve, and lessons learned.  In addition, the CIO will communicate steps being taken and progress to OMB and notify the agency head. Agencies will provide updates on the status of this program on a quarterly basis as a part of their IDC submission until the identified deficiency is resolved.

  - **TechStat Sessions.** A TechStat is a face-to-face, evidence-based accountability review of an IT program with agency leadership (^9).    TechStat sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in an investment, turning around underperforming investments, or terminating investments if appropriate. For all agency-led TechStat reviews of investments, the agency shall contact egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line, “[Agency Acronym] TechStat Notification,” at least two weeks ahead of the TechStat session. Agencies shall follow the agency’s TechStat policy and procedures based on the CIO.gov TechStat Toolkit when managing TechStat sessions. Agencies shall report the outcomes and outputs of all TechStat sessions through the quarterly IDC, including: the assessment described in _Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework_, a root cause analysis of performance issues, corrective action plans which address these causes, and a timeline for implementing the corrective actions. More detailed reporting guidance will be provided in the quarterly IDC instructions.

  - **High risk rating.** Given the size and complexity of the multi-billion dollar Federal IT Portfolio, it is critical to maintain a focus on the health of IT investments across the government. As required by CPIC guidance, the CIO evaluations reported to the ITDB for all major IT investments must reflect the CIO’s assessment of the current level of risk for the investment’s ability to accomplish its goals based on factors described in the CPIC guidance. 

  - **Automatic TechStats.** Moreover, if an investment has a high risk rating (red CIO evaluation in the ITDB) for three consecutive months beginning June 1, 2015, agencies must hold a TechStat session on that investment. The session must be held within 30 days of the completion of the third month. If this investment remains categorized with a red CIO evaluation one year following the TechStat session then OMB may take appropriate performance and/or budgetary actions until the agency has addressed the root cause and ensured the investment’s ability to complete the remaining activities within planned cost and schedule. 

3.  As explained in Attachment D, PortfolioStat is a data-driven tool that agencies use to assess the current maturity of their IT portfolio management processes and select PortfolioStat action items to strengthen their IT portfolio.  Covered agencies shall hold PortfolioStat sessions on a quarterly basis with OMB, the agency CIO, and other attendees.  (These sessions were previously annual and required the attendance of the agency deputy secretary (see _Implementing PortfolioStat_ (M-12-10)(^10) , _Fiscal Year 2013 PortfolioStat Guidance: Strengthening Federal IT Portfolio Management_ (M-13-09)(^11)  and _Fiscal Year 2014 PortfolioStat_ (M-14-08)(^12) . 
  - During these sessions, OMB and agencies will (^13): 
    - Discuss and update a multi-year strategy to identify and reduce duplication and waste within the IT portfolio of the agency, including component-level investments and to identify projected cost savings resulting from such strategy;
    - Identify or develop ways to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the IT investments of the agency;
    - Identify or develop opportunities to increase the use of shared-service delivery models;
    - Identify potential duplication and waste;
    - Develop plans for actions to optimize the IT portfolio, programs, and resources of the agency;
    - Review investments included in High Impact Programs; and
    - Develop ways to better align the IT portfolio, programs, and financial resources of the agency to long term mission requirements or strategic plans required by law.

  - Agencies must report the status of PortfolioStat action items in the IDC at least quarterly. Annually by April 30, agency heads shall review and certify the status of PortfolioStat action items with the agency CIO and send to OMB.

  - OMB will focus on the metrics highlighted in PortfolioStat materials, data submitted through the quarterly IDC process, and agency IT Major Business Case information developed through the CPIC process to assess agency PortfolioStat progress.  Complete FY 2015 PortfolioStat guidance is included in _Attachment D_.

###Section D: Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI)

OMB FDCCI Guidance(^14),  which was issued in March 2012, outlined the goals, responsibilities, and reporting requirements for agencies through the end of FY2015. Covered agencies shall continue to provide updates regarding phase one of FDCCI in their quarterly IDC submissions. OMB will publish updated FDCCI guidance by the end of FY 2015 which will describe the second phase of the initiative and will refresh and refocus the data center optimization strategy on the efficient and effective use of resources and implementation of the statutory requirements of FITARA.  

###Section E: Information Technology Acquisition Requirements

1.  IT Acquisition Cadres. FITARA’s requirements for IT acquisition cadres builds upon OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) July 2011 memorandum on building specialized IT acquisition cadres(^15).  As originally required by the memorandum, _Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic Plan for Civilian Agencies – FY 2010 – 2014_(^16)  of October 27, 2009, civilian CFO Act agencies shall continue to send their annual _Acquisition Human Capital Plans_ to OMB OFPP. The next iteration of those Plans was due April 15, 2015. Additional guidance from OMB issued in February 2015 requires agencies to address new reporting elements required by FITARA. Details regarding these new reporting elements are found in _Attachment F_.

2.  Category Management and the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI)(^17).  Agencies shall comply with the appropriate provisions of a new rule regarding purchases of services and supplies of types offered under an FSSI agreement without using an FSSI agreement. In February 2015, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council initiated rulemaking to implement this provision of FITARA. Once finalized, agencies will be required to include in the contract file a brief analysis of the comparative value, including price and non-price factors, between the services and supplies offered under the FSSI and services and supplies offered under the source or sources used for the purchase.  

3.  Government-Wide Software Purchasing Program. OMB established the Category Management initiative (^18)  in December 2014. The General Services Administration (GSA), in collaboration with OMB, shall create, and allow agencies access to, government-wide enterprise software licenses through new awards as part of category management, a practice adopted by industry where spending is managed by experts who  promote best practices and help agencies avoid unnecessary duplicative spending and activities. These awards shall, at a minimum, allow for the purchase of a license agreement that is available for use by all Executive agencies(^19).
