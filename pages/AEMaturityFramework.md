##Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework

When conducting TechStat reviews, PortfolioStat reviews, or evaluating investments related to High Impact Programs, agencies shall use the following framework for describing investment and portfolio management maturity with OMB. These scores may be compared or aggregated across bureaus, agencies, or government-wide to provide a summary of overall IT management maturity. This model may be updated over time as common root causes of implementation challenges or other common management issues are identified.

Agencies shall evaluate their performance in each of the following areas by comparing their performance to a set of criteria provided by OMB describing performance at three levels: (1) "Reacting", (2) "Implementing", and (3) "Optimizing". More information will be provided as a part of the PortfolioStat process.
