##Attachment A: Common Baseline for IT Management and CIO Assignment Plan

All covered agencies shall adopt specific controls for the management of IT from the “Common Baseline” below. The Common Baseline prescribes a basic set of specific responsibilities and processes that all covered agencies shall have in place no later than December 31, 2015. A set of definitions follows the Common Baseline to further clarify the specific responsibilities.
Throughout the Common Baseline:
- All references to “CIO” refer to department/headquarters CIOs, and only references to “bureau CIO” refer to the CIO or official-with-CIO-duties within a bureau or any component organization of the agency (see definitions). 
- If an agency has a “budget officer” separate from the CFO, then references to “CFO” shall refer also to the budget officer. 
- If an agency has a “senior procurement executive” separate from the CAO, then references to “CAO” shall refer also to the senior procurement executive.

The Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community, and portions of other agencies that operate systems related to national security are subject to only certain portions of FITARA and shall meet with OMB no later than 60 days following the release of this memorandum to clarify the applicability of this memorandum throughout their organizations and activities, including alternative requirements or exceptions.

####Common Baseline CIO Assignment Plan

- It is critical that the agency CIO retain accountability for the roles and responsibilities identified in the Common Baseline.  As agency environments vary considerably, CIOs may find that decisions about some IT resources included in the Common Baseline may be more appropriately executed by other agency officials, such as a Bureau CIO or even parts of program or procurement communities.  This must be done in a way to allow the agency CIO to retain accountability.

- For the responsibilities other than those detailed in D1 and M1 of the above chart (budget approval and Bureau CIO appointment), the CIO may designate other agency officials to act as a representative of the CIO in aspects of the above processes in a rules-based manner, such as by a dollar threshold, type of planned IT activity, or by bureau. This designation shall be developed in consultation with the CFO, CAO, CHCO, and other Senior Agency Officials as needed. Even if a representative is substituted for the CIO, the CIO retains accountability for the assigned role or responsibility and thus must ensure the overall suitability of selected officials. Because the selected official represents the CIO, CIOs should monitor the ongoing suitability of this designation and revise as appropriate. This allows the CIO to define a rules-based manner to select representatives such members of the CIO’s office, or a bureau CIO, to represent the CIO for portions of the Common Baseline responsibilities described above (such as for contract review of purchases of less than a certain dollar threshold). 

- Agencies which plan to use such a rules-based method must describe it in a “CIO Assignment Plan” (Plan) and submit it for OMB approval as detailed in Section B above.  Plans must show evidence that the CIO retains accountability for the designated alternative agency officials’ involvement and decisions and that the appropriate level of rigor shall be executed by this official in place of the CIO. The agency shall post the Plan publicly at agency.gov/digitalstrategy not more than 30 days following the Plan’s approval by OMB.

Related statutory language from FITARA:

- “A covered agency… may use the governance processes of the agency to approve such a contract or other agreement if the Chief Information Officer of the agency is included as a full participant in the governance processes.” Also, “[t]he head of each agency shall ensure that the Chief Information Officer of the agency has a significant role in… the decision processes for all annual and multi-year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution decisions, related reporting requirements, and reports related to IT and …the management, governance and oversight processes related to [IT].” 40 U.S.C. § 11319(b)(1)(A) and (C)(i)(III)
